Hey everyone! I started my journey as a software engineer when I first came to [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). Here I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science. Now I work full-time at Wells Fargo on the Primary Markets Platform.

I am also skilled in business and entrepreneurship, having founded and operated a clothing design company that reclaimed and repurposed vintage clothing for modern applications.

In my free time, I love to play chess, spend time with friends, do crosswords, and watch Christopher Nolan movies.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
